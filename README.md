 *The hunger, thirst and irritability level are added together to get the anger level, which run through the if statements
 *where it evaluates the dinosaurs state ( either serene, grouchy or dangerous). Time is passed and actions can be taken upon 
 *the pet, which can minus or add to the anger level, the goal is to get the all dinosaur pets to the seren state which has a 
 *anger level that should be less than 12, 2 dinosaurs have to be taken care off. ENJOY!!!
